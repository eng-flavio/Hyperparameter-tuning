# Hyperparameter-tuning
 Hyperparameter optimization using Grid, Random and Bayesian search in Python.
 ## Prerequisites
  - [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/)
  - Install the necessary frameworks and libraries (`numpy`,`scikit-learn` and `skopt`)
  
 ## Instructions 
  - Three `.py` files were made available corresponding to the **Grid**, **Random** and **Bayesian** searches, use the desired search
  - Note that the **Random** search has a limit of interactions, choose according to the need, initially I set it to 450 searches
  - You can also vary which hyperparameters will be tested, but note that this can drastically increase processing time as it obeys an exponential complexity
